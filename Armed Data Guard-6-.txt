The Codex Shell: Autonomous Devourer Mode ‚Äì Lethal Variant Œ© is your mythic-grade, self-elevating purge engine. Here's what it does for you‚Äîline by line, ritual by ritual:

üß† Real-Time Threat Detection
‚Ä¢ 	It continuously scans all active network connections on your system.
‚Ä¢ 	Every connection becomes a ‚Äúglyph‚Äù ‚Äî a symbolic entity with origin metadata, IP lineage, and mutation ID.
‚Ä¢ 	It validates each glyph for:
‚Ä¢ 	IP mismatches (unauthorized hops)
‚Ä¢ 	Unknown or blocked country origins
‚Ä¢ 	Resurrection (if the same glyph returns after being purged)

‚ò†Ô∏è Autonomous Purge Engine
‚Ä¢ 	If a glyph violates any rule, it is instantly purged ‚Äî no confirmation, no delay.
‚Ä¢ 	Purged glyphs are logged with:
‚Ä¢ 	Mutation ID
‚Ä¢ 	Origin country
‚Ä¢ 	Reason for purge
‚Ä¢ 	Timestamp

‚ôªÔ∏è Resurrection Detection
‚Ä¢ 	If a glyph reappears after being purged, it is marked as resurrected.
‚Ä¢ 	Resurrected glyphs are escalated and tracked more aggressively.
‚Ä¢ 	You see them in the GUI with a resurrection glyph () and a distinct color.

üîê Elevation Logic
‚Ä¢ 	The shell automatically elevates itself to run with administrator privileges.
‚Ä¢ 	This gives it full access to system-level telemetry, ports, and processes.
‚Ä¢ 	You never have to manually run it as admin ‚Äî it handles elevation on launch.

üåç Country-Based Filtering
‚Ä¢ 	You can allow or block countries via a GUI panel.
‚Ä¢ 	The shell uses a full ISO country list to classify glyphs by origin.
‚Ä¢ 	Glyphs from blocked countries are purged automatically.
‚Ä¢ 	You control the filter in real time.

üßø Symbolic GUI Overlays
‚Ä¢ 	Every glyph is visualized with a symbolic rune:
‚Ä¢ 	 for allowed
‚Ä¢ 	 for blocked
‚Ä¢ 	 for hijacked
‚Ä¢ 	 for unauthorized hop
‚Ä¢ 	 for resurrected
‚Ä¢ 	 for purged
‚Ä¢ 	 for pending
‚Ä¢ 	Mutation IDs are displayed below each glyph.
‚Ä¢ 	Colors reflect threat status: green, red, magenta, cyan, gray.

üß¨ Mutation Registry
‚Ä¢ 	Every glyph has a mutation hash ‚Äî a unique fingerprint.
‚Ä¢ 	The registry tracks:
‚Ä¢ 	Origin
‚Ä¢ 	Purge reason
‚Ä¢ 	Resurrection count
‚Ä¢ 	Time of last purge
‚Ä¢ 	This gives you forensic traceability of every threat.

üî• Data Protection Hooks
‚Ä¢ 	The shell is ready to monitor sensitive files and folders.
‚Ä¢ 	You can fuse in triggers to purge logs, block access, or self-destruct telemetry.
‚Ä¢ 	These hooks are modular ‚Äî ready to be activated when you escalate.

ü¶é Chameleon Mode
‚Ä¢ 	The GUI adapts based on threat level and glyph status.
‚Ä¢ 	Symbolic overlays mutate to reflect system state.
‚Ä¢ 	You can expand this to include stealth logic, process obfuscation, or role-based visuals.

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Panels
‚Ä¢ 	Live Canvas: shows glyphs in real time with symbolic feedback
‚Ä¢ 	Purge Log: displays the last 50 purge events
‚Ä¢ 	Country Filter: lets you allow/block countries dynamically

üß† What It Does for You
‚Ä¢ 	Gives you autonomous, real-time control over your system‚Äôs connections
‚Ä¢ 	Visualizes every threat as a symbolic glyph with mutation lineage
‚Ä¢ 	Purges threats instantly and tracks their resurrection
‚Ä¢ 	Elevates itself for full access without manual intervention
‚Ä¢ 	Lets you control origin filtering with a full country list
‚Ä¢ 	Prepares you for file protection, stealth mode, and swarm sync
This shell doesn‚Äôt just protect you. It devours threats, tracks their mutations, and evolves with every purge. It‚Äôs your living firewall, your symbolic sentinel, your mythic-grade defense daemon.
