Absolutely — here’s a full breakdown of what your Codex Purge Shell now does, feature by feature. This is the complete operational profile of your mythic-grade, auto-elevating shell:

🧿 Codex Purge Shell — Full Capabilities Overview
🔹 1. Auto-Elevation
• 	Automatically detects if the shell is running with administrator privileges.
• 	If not, it relaunches itself with elevated rights using .
• 	Ensures full access to protected registry keys like .

🔹 2. Registry Purge Engine
• 	Targets multiple telemetry and tracking vectors across Windows and Edge.
• 	Uses  for direct registry access (no subprocesses).
• 	Purges the following vectors:
• 	Activity History
• 	Advertising ID
• 	Tailored Experiences
• 	Telemetry
• 	Edge Personalization
• 	Each purge is logged and confirmed with symbolic overlay feedback.

🔹 3. Autonomous Mode
• 	When enabled, the shell:
• 	Automatically purges all vectors on launch.
• 	Monitors for resurrection attempts and re-purges if needed.
• 	Triggers swarm sync visualization after each purge.
• 	Autonomous mode setting is saved to disk and persists across launches.

🔹 4. Resurrection Detection
• 	Continuously monitors registry keys for changes.
• 	If a value is re-enabled (e.g. telemetry turned back on), it:
• 	Logs the resurrection event.
• 	Re-purges the offending key.
• 	Updates the threat matrix in the GUI.

🔹 5. Swarm Sync Visualization
• 	After each purge, a symbolic “swarm sync” is triggered.
• 	This represents propagation of purge rules across nodes.
• 	Logged as a visual event in the live log viewer.

🔹 6. Symbolic Overlays
• 	Every purge action is logged with symbolic feedback:
• 	✅ for success
• 	❌ for failure
• 	🧬 for symbolic purge
• 	🕸️ for swarm sync
• 	🧠 for resurrection detection
• 	These overlays appear in the live log viewer.

🔹 7. Live Log Viewer
• 	Scrollable text panel inside the GUI.
• 	Displays all purge events, errors, syncs, and status updates in real time.
• 	Automatically scrolls to the latest entry.

🔹 8. Threat Matrix
• 	GUI labels show the status of each vector:
• 	“Active” (red) if not purged
• 	“Purged” (green) if successfully disabled
• 	Updates dynamically after each purge or resurrection event.

🔹 9. Manual Controls
• 	GUI buttons allow manual purge of each vector.
• 	“Manual Override” button purges all vectors instantly.
• 	Confirmation dialogs prevent accidental purging.

🔹 10. Persistent Settings
• 	Autonomous mode setting is saved to .
• 	Automatically loaded on launch.
• 	No need to re-enable each time.

🔹 11. Crash Protection
• 	GUI wrapped in  to catch runtime errors.
• 	Any crash is logged to  and printed to console.

🔹 12. Log File Output
• 	All events are saved to  with timestamps.
• 	Includes purge actions, errors, elevation status, and resurrection detections.
