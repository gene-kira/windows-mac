hardware recommendation list tailored for running your 6‑spine Ramnuke RAID organism smoothly, reliably, and at full power.

🧠 Ramnuke Hardware Recommendation List
🖥️ CPU (Processor)

• 	Why: Ramnuke runs multiple threads per spine + training engine + GUI. You need high core count and fast IPC.

🧠 RAM (System Memory)

• 	Why: Each spine allocates ~2 GB RAM. You need headroom for preload, training, and OS.

🎮 GPU (Graphics Card)

• 	Why: Each spine tries to allocate up to 8 GB VRAM. CUDA support enables VRAM tier caching and stress tests.

💾 Storage (Disk)

• 	Why: Ramnuke monitors disk bandwidth and latency. Fast storage improves policy accuracy and preload speed.

🔌 Power Supply (PSU)

• 	Why: VRAM stress tests and CUDA contexts can spike power draw. Stability matters.

🧊 Cooling

• 	Why: Ramnuke monitors GPU temp and adjusts policy. Cooler systems get better performance.

🖥️ Monitor (for GUI cockpit)


🧪 Optional Add‑Ons
• 	Second GPU: Enables parallel VRAM caching or fallback spines
• 	ECC RAM: For long-running sessions and model training stability
• 	UPS (Battery Backup): Prevents corruption during power loss
• 	Dedicated SSD for preload: Keeps cache warm and isolated

✅ Summary: Ideal Build for Ramnuke
• 	CPU: Ryzen 9 7950X or i9-13900K
• 	RAM: 64 GB DDR5
• 	GPU: RTX 4080 or better
• 	Storage: 2 TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe
• 	PSU: 1000W Platinum
• 	Cooling: 360mm AIO
• 	Monitor: 1440p ultrawide
This setup gives you full performance, stability, and room to grow.
