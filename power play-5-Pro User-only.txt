This is a full Windows administration console, written in PyQt5, with deep OS‑level integration.
I’ll walk you through it in a way that makes the whole architecture click.

🧠 1. Purpose of the Program
This code creates a single, unified Windows control console that replaces:
• 	Task Manager
• 	Services Manager
• 	Startup Manager
• 	Add/Remove Programs
• 	UWP App Manager
• 	Provisioned App Manager
• 	Optional Features Manager
• 	Registry Editor
• 	System Monitor
• 	Logging Console
All inside one GUI.
It’s essentially a custom Windows Control Panel, but with more power and fewer restrictions.

🔐 2. Automatic Admin Elevation
The very first thing the program does is check:
• 	Am I running as Administrator?
If not, it relaunches itself with admin rights using:

This ensures the console always has full access to:
• 	Registry editing
• 	Service control
• 	UWP uninstall
• 	Win32 uninstall
• 	Killing protected processes
• 	Startup folder manipulation
This is critical because almost every feature requires elevated privileges.

🎨 3. Dark‑Themed PyQt5 GUI
The interface uses:
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
And applies a custom dark Fusion theme so the entire console looks like a modern admin tool.

🧩 4. Tabs Overview
Your console has seven major functional panels:
✔ Processes
A full process manager using .
✔ Services
A complete service controller using .
✔ Installed Apps (Win32)
Reads uninstall entries from the registry.
✔ Startup Items
Enables/disables startup  files.
✔ System Info
Live CPU and RAM meters.
✔ All Windows Apps
The most advanced tab — merges:
• 	Win32 apps
• 	UWP apps
• 	Provisioned apps
• 	Optional features
✔ Action Log
Every action is timestamped and recorded.

⚙️ 5. Processes Tab
This tab lists:
• 	Process name
• 	PID
• 	CPU %
• 	RAM usage
• 	User
• 	Kill button
Protected processes (lsass, csrss, wininit, etc.) are highlighted and require confirmation before killing.

🛠 6. Services Tab
Uses the Windows Service Manager API to:
• 	List all services
• 	Show their state
• 	Start/stop them
This is equivalent to .

📦 7. Installed Apps (Win32)
This tab reads uninstall entries from:
• 	HKLM\Software...\Uninstall
• 	HKCU\Software...\Uninstall
• 	WOW6432Node
Each entry shows:
• 	Display name
• 	Uninstall command
• 	Registry path
• 	Uninstall button
This is the classic “Programs and Features” list.

🚀 8. Startup Items
Reads  files from:
• 	Startup folder
• 	Disabled folder
You can enable/disable items by moving shortcuts between folders.

📊 9. System Info
A live system monitor:
• 	CPU usage (QProgressBar)
• 	RAM usage
Updated every second.

🧬 10. All Windows Apps Tab (The Big One)
This is the most complex and powerful part of the entire program.
It merges four different Windows ecosystems:
1. Win32 apps
From registry uninstall keys.
2. UWP apps
From PowerShell:

3. Provisioned apps
From:

4. Optional features
From:

Each entry shows:
• 	Name
• 	Type
• 	Status
• 	Source
• 	Registry path (if Win32)
• 	Action buttons
Special features:
• 	Copilot and Xbox entries are highlighted
• 	Win32 entries have full registry editing support
• 	UWP entries have uninstall buttons
• 	Provisioned and Feature entries show state

🔍 11. Search + Filter System
You added:
✔ A search bar
Matches across:
• 	Name
• 	Type
• 	Status
• 	Source
• 	Registry path
✔ A filter dropdown
Options:
• 	All
• 	Win32
• 	UWP
• 	Provisioned
• 	Feature
The table updates instantly as you type.

🗝 12. Full Registry Editor Integration
This is a full mini‑RegEdit built into your console.
When you click Edit Key on a Win32 app:
• 	A new window opens
• 	Shows all values in the key
• 	Lets you:
• 	Add values
• 	Edit values
• 	Delete values
• 	Delete the entire key
• 	Open RegEdit
Supported registry types:
• 	REG_SZ
• 	REG_EXPAND_SZ
• 	REG_MULTI_SZ
• 	REG_DWORD
• 	REG_QWORD
• 	REG_BINARY
• 	REG_NONE
• 	REG_LINK
• 	REG_RESOURCE_LIST
• 	REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR
• 	REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST
Binary values show a hex preview.

🧾 13. Logging System
Every action is logged with timestamps:
• 	Killed process
• 	Started/stopped service
• 	Uninstalled app
• 	Edited registry
• 	Deleted registry key
• 	Refreshed tabs
This gives you a full audit trail.

🔄 14. PowerShell Integration
The program uses PowerShell to retrieve:
• 	UWP apps
• 	Provisioned apps
• 	Optional features
It converts the output to JSON using:

Then Python parses it.

🧱 15. Safety Rails
The program includes confirmations for:
• 	Killing protected processes
• 	Deleting registry values
• 	Deleting registry keys
• 	Uninstalling UWP apps
• 	Uninstalling Win32 apps
This prevents accidental system damage.

🧠 16. Overall Architecture
This program is structured like a professional Windows admin tool:
• 	Backend layer
• 	psutil
• 	winreg
• 	win32service
• 	PowerShell JSON
• 	GUI layer
• 	PyQt5 widgets
• 	Dark theme
• 	Tabs
• 	Tables
• 	Dialogs
• 	Logic layer
• 	Process management
• 	Service control
• 	Registry editing
• 	UWP uninstall
• 	Startup management
• 	Filtering/searching
• 	Integration layer
• 	Unified app list
• 	Registry editor
• 	Logging
This is not a script — it’s a full application.
