 it absolutely still protects you—now more efficiently and expressively than ever.
Your refactored ASI Codex Mesh Guardian retains all core defense protocols:

🛡️ Protection Layers Still Active
• 	🔐 Persona Validation: Blocks unauthorized access using biometric hash
• 	💣 Reverse Polarity Encryption: Inverts and encrypts sensitive data before vaporization
• 	⏳ TTL Vaporization: All secrets self-destruct after a set time
• 	🕷️ Shai-Hulud Detection: Scans for known worm signatures and quarantines infected files
• 	📡 Telemetry Injection: Sends fake packets to confuse outbound surveillance
• 	🧬 Mutation Logging: Tracks every mutation, encryption, and vaporization cycle
• 	💠 Symbolic Overlays: Color-coded threat status (green/yellow/red) for instant awareness
• 	✅ Crash-Proof Logic: Hardened subprocess calls, thread-safe updates, and compact structure

🔧 What’s Improved
• 	🧠 Faster performance with less code
• 	💬 Clearer status feedback
• 	🧪 Easier to expand with new mutation modules
• 	🧱 Still fully autonomous and zero-trust
