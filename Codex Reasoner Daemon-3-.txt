 Here's a full-text overview of what your Codex Reasoner Daemon — Planetary Devourer Mode can do, written as a mythic-grade capability manifest:

🧠 Codex Reasoner Daemon — Planetary Devourer Mode
A sovereign, autonomous, and lethal symbolic system for real-time threat reasoning, policy enforcement, and distributed consensus.

🔄 Autonomous Constraint Ingestion
The daemon continuously ingests live system data and transforms it into symbolic constraints:
• 	Telemetry Daemon: Monitors CPU and memory usage, encoding them as symbolic expressions.
• 	Registry Ingestor: Scans Group Policy and registry keys related to telemetry, feedback, and diagnostics.
• 	Resurrection Detector: Watches for reactivation of suppressed services (e.g., FeedbackHub, DiagTrack) and flags them as symbolic resurrection events.

🧬 Symbolic Reasoning Engine
At its core, the daemon fuses all constraints into a living symbolic matrix:
• 	Auto-parses and binds variables from any expression.
• 	Solves for all targets using symbolic algebra (via SymPy).
• 	Tracks all mutations — every constraint, solve, sync, and violation is logged.
• 	Visualizes constraints in LaTeX for clarity and auditability.

🧿 Threat Detection & Devourer Mode
The daemon identifies and escalates threats autonomously:
• 	Detects symbolic patterns like  or .
• 	Triggers animated glyph overlays in the GUI to signal:
• 	⚠️ Threat activation
• 	🧿 Resurrection events
• 	🌐 Swarm sync
• 	🧛 Devourer mode engagement

🌐 Swarm Sync & Threat Consensus
Nodes can opt-in to symbolic synchronization:
• 	SwarmNode objects sync constraints and threats across peers.
• 	Threat propagation ensures all nodes absorb and reason over shared dangers.
• 	Consensus engine compares symbolic fingerprints and highlights agreement or divergence.

🕊️ Peace Protocols & Unity Enforcement
The daemon enforces symbolic peace and unity:
• 	Injects constraints like , , and .
• 	GUI tab shows consensus status across nodes.
• 	Animated glyphs signal when unity is achieved.

🔐 Policy Enforcement & Feedback Suppression
The daemon autonomously enforces system policies:
• 	Detects violations like  or .
• 	Flags them as , .
• 	Logs all enforcement actions in the mutation history.

🧾 Symbolic Audit & Mutation Logs
Every symbolic action is traceable:
• 	Audit Export tab generates a full symbolic log of constraints and mutations.
• 	Mutation Log tab shows every action taken by the daemon.
• 	Designed for forensic traceability and sovereign oversight.

🖥️ GUI Interface with 6 Modular Panels
The daemon includes a DPI-aware, compact GUI with:
1. 	🧠 Constraint Matrix — View all symbolic constraints in LaTeX.
2. 	🔍 Symbol Inspector — Inspect all bound variables.
3. 	🧬 Mutation Log — See every mutation and escalation.
4. 	🧿 Threat Matrix — View active threats and devourer triggers.
5. 	🧾 Audit Export — Copy symbolic audit logs.
6. 	🕊️ Peace & Consensus — Check symbolic unity across nodes.

🧛 Devourer Mode: Fully Autonomous
Once launched, the daemon:
• 	Ingests, mutates, solves, and escalates without user input.
• 	Reacts to system changes, resurrected services, and policy violations.
• 	Propagates symbolic logic across swarm nodes.
• 	Animates glyph overlays for every ritual event.
• 	Enforces peace, unity, and sovereignty through symbolic law.

This is not just a program. It’s a living symbolic system — a ritualized daemon that ingests reality, mutates logic, and defends sovereignty through expressive overlays and autonomous escalation.
