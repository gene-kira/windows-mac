Absolutely. Here's a full breakdown of what the Codex Sentinel Shell can do — now that it's fully fused with real-time modules, animated overlays, and GUI control:

🧠 Codex Sentinel Shell — Capabilities Overview
This script is a mythic-grade, autonomous firewall sentinel designed to run on your system with full GUI control and real-time threat awareness. Here's what it does:

🔐 Real-Time Port Defense
• 	Binds to a rotating set of TCP ports (default: 5 at a time).
• 	Monitors those ports for incoming connection attempts using non-blocking sockets and .
• 	Automatically rotates ports on a timer (30 min, 1 hr, or 6 hr) — or instantly if a threat is detected.

🛡️ Threat Detection & Auto-Rotation
• 	Detects real incoming probes or connection attempts.
• 	Logs the IP address and country of origin using GeoIP lookup ().
• 	If the connection comes from a disallowed country, it blocks and logs the event.
• 	Triggers immediate port rotation when a probe or blocked country is detected.

☠️ Resurrection Detection
• 	Tracks ports that were previously closed.
• 	If a port is reopened in a future rotation, it logs a “Resurrection” event in the Threat Matrix.

🌐 Country-Based Filtering
• 	GUI dropdown lets you select an allowed country (e.g., US, UK, DE).
• 	Any incoming connection from a different country is flagged and blocked.
• 	Fully dynamic — changes take effect instantly.

✅ Allow/Disallow Port Lists
• 	GUI controls let you define which ports are allowed or disallowed.
• 	Rotation pool is filtered accordingly:
• 	If the allow list is active, only those ports are considered.
• 	Disallowed ports are always excluded.
• 	You can add/remove ports or clear the lists at any time.

📜 Live Log Viewer
• 	Streams real-time system events:
• 	Rotation updates
• 	Country changes
• 	Allow/disallow list changes
• 	Errors or connection handling issues

🧠 Threat Matrix Panel
• 	Logs symbolic threat events:
• 	⚠️ Probes
• 	🌐 Blocked IPs
• 	☠️ Resurrections
• 	Timestamped and scrollable for forensic review

🧬 Animated Port Status Overlay
• 	Real-time glyphs show port status:
• 	🟢 Open and idle
• 	🔴 Recently probed (flashes red for 5 seconds)
• 	☠️ Resurrected (glows purple)
• 	Updates every second with live feedback

🖥️ GUI Control Panel
• 	Built with Tkinter — compact, DPI-aware, and responsive
• 	Includes:
• 	Firewall toggle (Start/Stop)
• 	Rotation interval selector
• 	Country selector
• 	Live logs
• 	Threat matrix
• 	Port status overlay
• 	Allow/disallow list management

🧠 Autonomous Logic
• 	Runs as a self-contained daemon with multiple threads:
• 	Port rotation
• 	Threat detection
• 	Overlay updates
• 	GUI refresh
• 	Elevates itself to admin on Windows if needed
• 	Cloaks ports using  on Linux

This shell is not just a firewall — it’s a living ritual of defense, mutation, and visualization. Every probe becomes a glyph. Every resurrection is logged. Every port is sovereign.
