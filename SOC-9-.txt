let me walk you through what this SOC-9- codebase actually is and how it thinks, in a way that feels human and digestible rather than just “here’s a giant Python file.”
You built something genuinely unusual here.
This isn’t a normal monitoring script.
It’s a self‑learning, multi‑worker, multi‑signal, swarm‑capable security/ops guardian with a GUI cockpit.
Let’s break it down.

🧠 1. The Queen Brain (Core Intelligence)
At the center is the QueenBrain class — this is the “AI brain” that:
• 	Receives telemetry from workers
• 	Learns habits of processes
• 	Computes risk scores
• 	Decides actions (WATCH / QUARANTINE / KILL)
• 	Evolves its own strategy
• 	Maintains trust profiles
• 	Tracks signatures
• 	Runs clustering
• 	Syncs with swarm nodes
• 	Stores everything in a persistent JSON “brain”
It’s basically a self‑tuning security engine.
Key responsibilities:
Risk scoring
It uses a blend of signals:
• 	CPU/MEM behavior vs learned habits
• 	Time‑of‑day anomaly
• 	Network anomaly
• 	File spike anomaly
• 	Signature changes
• 	Cluster distance
• 	Trust tier
• 	Global system stress
• 	Paranoia level
• 	Strategy aggressiveness
Then it applies a tiny online learning model (9‑feature linear adjuster) that updates itself based on its own decisions.
Threat timeline
Every suspicious process gets a timeline:
• 	Each event = (time, risk, action, CPU, MEM, signals)
• 	The GUI shows a risk evolution graph per identity
• 	The Queen uses the slope of the risk curve to make predictive decisions
Trust evolution
Processes earn or lose trust based on behavior:
• 	Good behavior → trust up
• 	Bad behavior → trust down
• 	Trust influences risk multipliers
Strategy evolution
Every minute, the Queen:
• 	Simulates several candidate strategies
• 	Scores them
• 	Adopts the best one
• 	This changes thresholds, intervals, aggressiveness
It’s like a mini genetic algorithm.
Persistence
Everything is saved:
• 	Admin password (salted hash)
• 	Profiles
• 	Trust
• 	Signatures
• 	Cluster labels
• 	ML weights
• 	Strategy
• 	Paranoia
• 	Swarm endpoint
It also supports network backup.

🕸️ 2. Workers (The Queen’s Eyes & Hands)
There are four autonomous workers:
ProcessScannerWorker
• 	Scans all processes
• 	Builds a graph of parent/child relationships
• 	Sends NodeInfo + EdgeInfo to the Queen
SystemMetricsWorker
• 	Tracks CPU, memory, disk
• 	Detects global stress
• 	Adjusts worker intervals
NetworkScannerWorker
• 	Tracks outgoing connections
• 	Tracks listening ports
• 	Feeds network anomaly signals
FileActivityWorker
• 	Watches protected directories
• 	Detects mass file creation/deletion spikes
Each worker:
• 	Has adaptive intervals
• 	Reports status to the GUI
• 	Runs independently

🧩 3. The GUI Cockpit
The GUI is a full control center with tabs:
Overview
• 	Global CPU/MEM/DISK
• 	Strategy summary
• 	Paranoia level
• 	Hot processes
• 	Habit profiles
Workers
• 	Live worker status table
Events
• 	Full event log
Process Map
• 	A live graph of processes
• 	Red nodes = suspicious
• 	Spring layout
Threat Timeline
• 	Table of identities
• 	Click one → see risk evolution graph
Admin Tab
Locked until password is entered.
Admin can:
• 	Enable real enforcement
• 	Change paranoia
• 	Enable online ML
• 	Change admin password
• 	Set network backup path
• 	Set swarm endpoint
• 	Save brain
• 	Shutdown Queen
This is your “security cockpit.”

🔮 4. Predictive Enhancements (v11)
This version includes:
Risk slope prediction
If a process’s risk is rising fast, the Queen escalates earlier.
Online learning tuning
• 	Action‑specific learning rates
• 	Target risk zones
• 	Feature normalization
• 	Weight decay
• 	More stable learning
Cluster‑aware anomaly scoring
Processes far from their cluster center get extra risk.
Signature scanning
Executable hash changes → instant anomaly.
Global stress integration
High system load increases risk sensitivity.

🌐 5. Swarm Sync
The Queen can sync with other nodes:
• 	Shares trust profiles
• 	Shares signature hashes
• 	Shares recent actions
• 	Merges remote trust
• 	Averages dynamic trust
• 	Expands signature knowledge
This makes it a distributed security organism.

🧬 6. The Code Architecture in One Sentence
It’s a self‑learning, multi‑worker, multi‑signal, swarm‑capable security guardian with a full GUI cockpit, adaptive strategy engine, trust evolution, signature scanning, clustering, and predictive risk scoring — all in one Python file.
