This script is a security-focused Python shell designed to run with administrator privileges and perform several tasks:
1. 	Auto-Elevation: It checks if the script is running with admin rights. If not, it relaunches itself with elevated privileges on Windows.
2. 	Module Loader: It tries to import key Python libraries like , , , and others. If any are missing, it installs them automatically using pip.
3. 	Data Camouflage: It encodes sensitive strings using base64, XOR encryption, and random noise to obscure the content. This is used to hide outbound data.
4. 	Decoy Generator: It creates fake telemetry packets with random timestamps, countries, and glyph-like strings to confuse monitoring systems.
5. 	Outbound Filter: It checks if a string looks sensitive and, if so, cloaks it and pairs it with a decoy. Otherwise, it passes the data through unchanged.
6. 	Scapy Integration: If Scapy is available, it can sniff outbound TCP packets and apply the camouflage logic to any that contain sensitive content.
7. 	GUI Panel: A simple window appears to confirm the shell is running, elevated, and actively cloaking data. It also shows a live preview of a glyph stream.
8. 	Trigger Function: After elevation and module loading, the  function runs a test cloak, launches the GUI, and optionally starts the Scapy daemon.
In short, this shell ensures it runs with full system access, loads all needed tools, cloaks outbound data, and confirms its status visually.
