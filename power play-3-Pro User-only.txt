This is a PyQt5‑based Windows System Console that combines:
• 	A task manager
• 	A service manager
• 	A startup manager
• 	A system monitor
• 	A UWP/Provisioned/Feature scanner
• 	A Win32 uninstall scanner
• 	A full internal registry editor
• 	A logging system
• 	Admin elevation
• 	Dark‑themed GUI
All inside one Python file.
Below is the full conceptual breakdown.

🧠 1. The Program’s Purpose
This code creates a Windows control console that gives you deep visibility and control over:
• 	Running processes
• 	Windows services
• 	Startup items
• 	Installed Win32 apps
• 	Microsoft Store (UWP) apps
• 	Provisioned apps
• 	Optional Windows features
• 	Registry uninstall keys
• 	System resource usage
It’s essentially a mini Windows Control Panel + Task Manager + RegEdit + App Manager in one.

🧩 2. Admin Elevation
At startup, the program checks:

If not, it relaunches itself with:

This ensures the console always runs with full administrator privileges, which are required for:
• 	Killing protected processes
• 	Starting/stopping services
• 	Editing registry keys
• 	Removing UWP apps
• 	Deleting uninstall entries

🖥️ 3. The GUI Framework
The entire interface is built with PyQt5, using:
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
• 	
The theme is set to a dark Fusion palette, giving it a modern admin‑tool look.

📑 4. Tabs Overview
Your console has seven major tabs:
✔ Processes
Lists all running processes using .
Shows:
• 	Name
• 	PID
• 	CPU %
• 	RAM MB
• 	User
• 	Kill button
Protected processes (lsass, csrss, wininit, etc.) are highlighted.

✔ Services
Uses  to list all Windows services.
You can:
• 	Start a service
• 	Stop a service
• 	Refresh the list

✔ Installed Apps (Win32)
Reads uninstall entries from:
• 	HKLM\Software...\Uninstall
• 	HKCU\Software...\Uninstall
• 	WOW6432Node
Shows:
• 	App name
• 	Uninstall command
• 	Registry path
• 	Uninstall button

✔ Startup Items
Reads  files from:
• 	Startup folder
• 	Disabled folder
You can enable/disable startup entries by moving shortcuts.

✔ System Info
Shows live:
• 	CPU usage
• 	RAM usage
Updated every second with a QTimer.

✔ Action Log
Every action (kill process, uninstall app, edit registry, etc.) is logged with timestamps.

✔ All Windows Apps (The Big One)
This is the most advanced tab.
It merges four different Windows app ecosystems:
1. Win32 apps
From registry uninstall keys.
2. UWP apps
From PowerShell:

3. Provisioned apps
From:

4. Optional features
From:

Each entry shows:
• 	Name
• 	Type (Win32/UWP/Provisioned/Feature)
• 	Status
• 	Source
• 	Registry path (if Win32)
• 	Actions
Special highlighting for:
• 	Xbox
• 	Copilot

🔧 5. Win32 Registry Integration
For Win32 apps, the code stores:
• 	Root hive (HKLM or HKCU)
• 	Subkey path
• 	Full registry path
This enables:
✔ Open RegEdit
Launches regedit.exe.
✔ Edit Key
Opens the internal registry editor window.
✔ Delete Key
Deletes the entire uninstall key.

🧬 6. Internal Registry Editor (Non‑Modal Window)
This is one of the most powerful parts.
When you click Edit Key, a new window opens showing:
✔ Registry path
Displayed at the top.
✔ Table of values
Columns:
• 	Name
• 	Type
• 	Data
✔ Buttons
• 	Add Value
• 	Edit Value
• 	Delete Value
• 	Delete Key
• 	Open in RegEdit
✔ Full registry type support
You chose Option 2, so it supports all types:
• 	REG_SZ
• 	REG_EXPAND_SZ
• 	REG_MULTI_SZ
• 	REG_DWORD
• 	REG_QWORD
• 	REG_BINARY
• 	REG_NONE
• 	REG_LINK
• 	REG_RESOURCE_LIST
• 	REG_FULL_RESOURCE_DESCRIPTOR
• 	REG_RESOURCE_REQUIREMENTS_LIST
✔ Auto‑switching binary editor
• 	Small binary → hex string
• 	Large binary → truncated preview
(You can expand this later into a full hex grid.)

🧠 7. PowerShell Integration
The code uses PowerShell to retrieve:
• 	UWP apps
• 	Provisioned apps
• 	Optional features
It converts the output to JSON using:

Then Python parses it.

🧹 8. Safety Rails
The console includes confirmations for:
• 	Killing protected processes
• 	Deleting registry values
• 	Deleting registry keys
• 	Uninstalling UWP apps
• 	Uninstalling Win32 apps
This prevents accidental system damage.

🧾 9. Logging
Every action is appended to the log tab with timestamps:

This gives you a full audit trail.

🧩 10. Summary of What You Built
This code is essentially:
✔ A Task Manager
✔ A Service Manager
✔ A Startup Manager
✔ A System Monitor
✔ A Win32 App Manager
✔ A UWP App Manager
✔ A Provisioned App Manager
✔ A Windows Feature Manager
✔ A Registry Editor
✔ A Logging Console
✔ A Dark‑Themed Admin Tool
All in one file.
It’s a Swiss‑army knife for Windows administration, built in Python.
