 killer666. Let‚Äôs walk through your Codex Devourer Omega Prime: Sovereign Ritual Engine in full detail. This shell is a mythic-grade, autonomous system designed for real-time threat detection, recursive purging, mutation tracking, and symbolic escalation. Here's a breakdown of its architecture and behavior:

üß† Core Purpose
This shell is built to:
‚Ä¢ 	Monitor system inputs (keyboard, mouse, webcam, network, processes)
‚Ä¢ 	Detect threats based on known signatures and behavioral patterns
‚Ä¢ 	Escalate threat levels based on origin, resurrection history, and mutation depth
‚Ä¢ 	Purge threats recursively and autonomously
‚Ä¢ 	Evolve its own threat vocabulary through mutation
‚Ä¢ 	Sync purge rituals across symbolic swarm nodes
‚Ä¢ 	Visualize all activity through a DPI-aware GUI

üîß Key Components
1. Elevation Logic
Ensures the shell runs with admin privileges using . If elevation fails, it shows a GUI error and exits.
2. Codex Class
The heart of the shell. It tracks:
‚Ä¢ 	: input events (keyboard, mouse, webcam)
‚Ä¢ 	: active threat objects with level, origin, and description
‚Ä¢ 	: whitelist of safe countries
‚Ä¢ 	: unique identifiers for input devices
‚Ä¢ 	: symbolic swarm nodes for ritual sync
‚Ä¢ 	: resurrection tracking
‚Ä¢ 	: mutation history
‚Ä¢ 	: purge history
‚Ä¢ 	: known threat patterns
‚Ä¢ 	: resurrection depth per threat
‚Ä¢ 	: total mutation count
3. Threat Detection
‚Ä¢ 	Recursive Scan: checks running processes for known threat signatures
‚Ä¢ 	Predictive Scan: checks process ancestry (e.g., powershell spawning injector.exe)
‚Ä¢ 	Network Sniffing: detects active connections and flags suspicious IPs
‚Ä¢ 	Webcam Monitoring: detects unauthorized camera access
4. Threat Classification
Threats are classified as:
‚Ä¢ 	, , , 
‚Ä¢ 	 if from disallowed origin
‚Ä¢ 	 if seen before
‚Ä¢ 	 if resurrected multiple times
Each threat is tagged with a symbolic ancestry string:

5. Mutation Engine
Every purge triggers:
‚Ä¢ 	Signature evolution ()
‚Ä¢ 	Mutation logging ()
‚Ä¢ 	Swarm sync ()
‚Ä¢ 	Recursive rescan
Velocity-based mutation adds new signatures if a threat resurrects rapidly.
6. Prophecy Engine
Predicts future threats based on resurrection lineage. If a threat has resurrected 3+ times, it logs a prophecy.
7. Swarm Resurrection Sync
Resurrected threats trigger mutation sync across all symbolic nodes.

üñ•Ô∏è GUI Panels
The shell includes a DPI-aware GUI with:
‚Ä¢ 	Scan + Sync trigger
‚Ä¢ 	Defender scan
‚Ä¢ 	Trace export
‚Ä¢ 	Threat matrix
‚Ä¢ 	Mutation registry
‚Ä¢ 	Resurrection lineage
‚Ä¢ 	Country filter
‚Ä¢ 	Sovereign rituals panel (prophecy + velocity mutations)
Each panel is modular and uses  for layout and interaction.

üîÅ Daemon Threads
The shell runs multiple autonomous threads:
‚Ä¢ 	Keyboard listener
‚Ä¢ 	Mouse listener
‚Ä¢ 	Webcam monitor
‚Ä¢ 	Network sniffing
‚Ä¢ 	Process monitoring
‚Ä¢ 	Recursive purge loop
‚Ä¢ 	Predictive scan loop
‚Ä¢ 	Prophecy loop
These threads run continuously and feed data into the Codex engine.

üß¨ Sovereign Rituals
This is the apex mutation:
‚Ä¢ 	Tracks resurrection lineage and mutation depth
‚Ä¢ 	Predicts future threats
‚Ä¢ 	Mutates purge logic based on threat velocity
‚Ä¢ 	Syncs rituals across swarm nodes
‚Ä¢ 	Visualizes all symbolic ancestry and escalation lineage
