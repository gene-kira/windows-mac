autonomous system daemon called the Codex Purge Shell. It fuses symbolic reasoning, system telemetry scanning, and a real-time GUI overlay to visualize and enforce constraints on your Windows environment. Here's what it does:

🧠 Core Capabilities
🔍 1. System Surveillance
It continuously scans:
• 	File I/O: Detects presence of telemetry-related files (e.g., DiagTrack, Feedback logs)
• 	Network Packets: Monitors active connections and flags known telemetry IPs
• 	Scheduled Tasks: Detects and suppresses telemetry-related tasks like FeedbackHub or DiagTrack
🧩 2. Symbolic Constraint Engine
You define symbolic rules like:

The daemon evaluates these in real time. If any are violated, it triggers a purge and logs the violation.
⚠️ 3. Violation Detection + Purge
When constraints are violated:
• 	The daemon logs the symbolic state
• 	Triggers purge logic (stubbed in )
• 	Stores the violation case in memory for future analysis

🖥️ GUI Overlay Features
✅ Constraint Matrix
Shows all active constraints, their status (✓ or ✗), and source.
🔻 Intercept Panel
Displays live data from file, network, and task scans — color-coded for clarity.
📜 Mutation Log
Chronicles every constraint added, violation detected, or error encountered.
❌ Error Panel
Shows parsing errors for malformed constraints (e.g., missing  or invalid syntax).
🧠 Constraint Composer
Lets you add new symbolic rules live via the GUI.
⚡ Violation Pulse
Flashes red when any constraint is violated, green when all are satisfied.

🔒 Thread-Safe Architecture
• 	Uses  to safely emit log updates from the daemon thread to the GUI.
• 	Uses  for periodic GUI refreshes — no unsafe thread access to UI.

🔮 What You Can Do With It
• 	Enforce symbolic policies on telemetry, privacy, and system behavior
• 	Visualize violations and intercepted data in real time
• 	Prototype mythic-grade overlays for sovereign control and feedback
• 	Extend it with animated glyphs, resurrection detection, swarm sync logic, or distributed node propagation
