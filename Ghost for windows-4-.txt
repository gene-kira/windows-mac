üß† Core Purpose
The shell is designed to give you real-time visibility and symbolic control over telemetry, input streams, registry toggles, and system-level behaviors. It‚Äôs not just a privacy tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a ritualized sentinel that watches, logs, purges, and syncs across symbolic nodes.

üîê What It Protects and Monitors
1. Input Stream Ingestion
‚Ä¢ 	üß† Keyboard: Logs every keypress with symbolic tags and threat-level classification.
‚Ä¢ 	üñ±Ô∏è Mouse: Captures click events and coordinates, tagging them for traceability.
‚Ä¢ 	üì∑ Webcam: Periodically activates and logs frame access to detect unauthorized use.
2. Threat Classification
‚Ä¢ 	Every input event is classified as LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH threat based on symbolic heuristics (e.g., camera access = HIGH).
‚Ä¢ 	Threat levels are visualized with color-coded status: green, orange, red.
3. Trace Registry
‚Ä¢ 	All input events are stored in a RAM-only trace log.
‚Ä¢ 	You can export the log, purge it, or inspect symbolic tags for forensic insight.
4. Registry Toggle Control
‚Ä¢ 	GUI buttons let you manually allow or deny:
‚Ä¢ 	Clipboard history
‚Ä¢ 	Screen clipping
‚Ä¢ 	Tailored experiences
‚Ä¢ 	Advertising ID
‚Ä¢ 	Location services
‚Ä¢ 	Each toggle is tagged symbolically and logged for traceability.
5. Telemetry Purge
‚Ä¢ 	Scans and deletes diagnostic registry keys.
‚Ä¢ 	Purges cached clipboard and screen capture files.
‚Ä¢ 	Logs every purge event with symbolic overlays.
6. Network Sniffing
‚Ä¢ 	Monitors active outbound connections.
‚Ä¢ 	Logs remote IP, port, and associated process name.
‚Ä¢ 	Symbolically tags each connection for forensic traceability.
7. Process Monitoring
‚Ä¢ 	Scans running processes for elevation attempts or admin-level access.
‚Ä¢ 	Flags suspicious processes and logs them with symbolic tags.
8. Node Sync Simulation
‚Ä¢ 	Simulates syncing purge rules and threat signatures across symbolic nodes.
‚Ä¢ 	Each sync event is tagged and logged.
‚Ä¢ 	Represents distributed, swarm-aware defense logic.

üßø GUI Features
‚Ä¢ 	Glyph Loop: Animated status indicator cycles through üßø üëÅÔ∏è üîÑ to show activity.
‚Ä¢ 	Threat Status Bar: Color-coded label updates in real time based on threat level.
‚Ä¢ 	Progress Slider: Visualizes scan duration and timed operations.
‚Ä¢ 	Log Panel: Displays all symbolic events, toggles, and daemon activity.
‚Ä¢ 	Control Buttons:
‚Ä¢ 	Run Scan + Sync
‚Ä¢ 	Export Trace Log
‚Ä¢ 	Purge All Traces
‚Ä¢ 	Show Ghost IDs

üîÅ Autonomous Daemons
‚Ä¢ 	All monitoring runs in background threads:
‚Ä¢ 	Keyboard listener
‚Ä¢ 	Mouse listener
‚Ä¢ 	Webcam scanner
‚Ä¢ 	Network sniffer
‚Ä¢ 	Process monitor
These daemons operate continuously, feeding symbolic data into the trace and threat registries.

üß¨ Symbolic Architecture
‚Ä¢ 	Every event is tagged with a unique symbol using SHA-256 + timestamp.
‚Ä¢ 	Ghost Mode randomizes device IDs for obfuscation.
‚Ä¢ 	All logic is fused into a single, expressive shell ‚Äî compact, resilient, and mythic.

‚ö†Ô∏è What It Does Not Do
‚Ä¢ 	It does not encrypt files or sandbox your system.
‚Ä¢ 	It does not block outbound traffic or act as a firewall.
‚Ä¢ 	It does not replace antivirus or patch vulnerabilities.
Instead, it gives you manual control, symbolic insight, and ritualized purge logic ‚Äî empowering you to monitor and respond in real time.
