This is not a toy — it’s essentially a miniature Windows Control Center with dangerous capabilities when Paranoid Mode is enabled.
Let’s break it down.

🏗️ 1. Program Startup & Admin Elevation
The program begins by checking:

If the user is NOT admin, it relaunches itself with:

This ensures the entire console always runs with full administrative privileges.

📦 2. Major Subsystems
Your code is organized into functional blocks:
✔ Win32 Installed Apps
Reads uninstall entries from:
• 	
• 	
• 	32‑bit WOW6432Node equivalents
It extracts:
• 	DisplayName
• 	UninstallString
• 	Registry path
And allows:
• 	Normal uninstall
• 	Registry key deletion
• 	Force Remove (in Paranoid Mode)

✔ UWP Apps
Uses PowerShell:

Supports:
• 	Uninstall for current user
• 	Uninstall for all users
• 	Force Remove (removes provisioned + installed copies)

✔ Provisioned Apps
Uses:

Supports:
• 	Remove provisioned
• 	Remove for all users
• 	Force Remove

✔ Optional Features
Uses:

Allows toggling Windows components like:
• 	.NET Framework
• 	Hyper‑V
• 	SMB1
• 	Media Features

✔ Windows Services
Uses Win32 APIs to:
• 	List services
• 	Start
• 	Stop
Displays:
• 	Service name
• 	Display name
• 	Current state

✔ Processes
Uses  to:
• 	List all processes
• 	Show CPU, RAM, user
• 	Kill processes
• 	Highlight protected system processes
Protected processes require triple confirmation.

✔ Startup Items
Reads  files from:
• 	Startup folder
• 	Disabled folder
Allows:
• 	Enable
• 	Disable

✔ Registry Editor
A full GUI registry editor:
• 	View values
• 	Add
• 	Edit
• 	Delete
• 	Delete key
• 	Open in RegEdit
Supports all registry types:
• 	REG_SZ
• 	REG_DWORD
• 	REG_QWORD
• 	REG_MULTI_SZ
• 	REG_BINARY

✔ System Info Tab
Shows:
• 	System name
• 	Windows version
• 	Total RAM
• 	Used/free RAM
• 	All drives with total/used/free
• 	Live CPU meter
• 	Live RAM meter
Updates every second.

✔ Unified “All Windows Apps” Panel
This is the most advanced part.
It merges:
• 	Win32 apps
• 	UWP apps
• 	Provisioned apps
• 	Optional features
Into one table with:
• 	Name
• 	Type
• 	Status
• 	Source
• 	Registry path
• 	Removable
• 	Actions
Filtering supports:
• 	Search
• 	Type filter
• 	Removable only
Actions dynamically change depending on:
• 	App type
• 	Paranoid Mode state

🔥 3. Paranoid Mode (Your Custom Safety System)
This is a unique feature you designed.
It includes:
✔ A left‑to‑right ON/OFF switch
• 	OFF button
• 	LED indicator
• 	ON button
✔ LED
• 	Red when OFF
• 	Green when ON
✔ Label glow
• 	Red glowing border when ON
• 	Normal when OFF
✔ Warning icon
Visible only when ON.
✔ Behavior
When ON:
• 	Force Remove buttons appear
• 	Advanced Actions drawer can open
When OFF:
• 	Force Remove buttons disappear
• 	Advanced Actions drawer auto‑closes
This prevents accidental system damage.

🧰 4. Advanced Actions Drawer
A collapsible panel containing:
• 	Reload PowerShell data
• 	Force full refresh
Only available when Paranoid Mode is ON.

📝 5. Logging System
Every action is logged with timestamps into a QTextEdit.
Examples:
• 	“Killed process X”
• 	“Started service Y”
• 	“Force removed UWP app Z”
This gives you a full audit trail.

🧩 6. Plugin Loader
Loads Python files from a  folder.
This allows extending the console without modifying the main file.

🎨 7. Dark Theme + UI Enhancements
You apply a custom Fusion dark palette:
• 	Dark backgrounds
• 	White text
• 	Blue highlights
Tables use:
• 	Auto‑resize
• 	Stretch columns
• 	Sorting
• 	Embedded buttons

🧨 8. Danger Confirmation System
For destructive actions, you require:
1. 	Confirm
2. 	Are you absolutely sure
3. 	FINAL WARNING
This prevents catastrophic mistakes.

🧩 9. Architecture Summary
Your program is essentially:
✔ A Windows Control Panel
✔ A Task Manager
✔ A Registry Editor
✔ A PowerShell front‑end
✔ A UWP/Provisioned app remover
✔ A Startup Manager
✔ A Services Manager
✔ A System Info dashboard
✔ A plugin‑ready admin console
✔ A dangerous‑actions‑protected environment
All in one unified PyQt5 application.

🎯 10. What Makes Your Console Unique
• 	Paranoid Mode (custom safety layer)
• 	Unified app management (Win32 + UWP + Provisioned + Features)
• 	Full registry editor
• 	Admin auto‑elevation
• 	Advanced drawer
• 	Live system telemetry
• 	Force Remove capabilities
• 	Column auto‑resize
• 	Left→right ON/OFF switch with LED
This is far beyond a typical Python GUI — it’s a full administrative toolkit.
