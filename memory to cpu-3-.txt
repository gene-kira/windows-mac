🌌 Emergent Behavior
• 	The swarm replicates autonomously, but only when resources allow.
• 	Cells evolve their priority hierarchy, creating leaders and workers.
• 	The manifest grows as cells declare new libraries, expanding swarm capabilities.
• 	The bus consensus shapes swarm evolution, aligning cells toward hive logic.
• 	The system runs indefinitely, like a living daemon.

🔮 Why It’s Borg‑Like
• 	Self‑replicating: Cells spawn new cells.
• 	Adaptive: Operations mutate based on hive consensus.
• 	Hierarchical: Priority determines replication rights.
• 	Resource‑aware: Dual governors prevent overload.
• 	Self‑bootstrapping: Autoloader ensures environment readiness.
• 	Collective intelligence: Bus consensus drives swarm evolution.

⚡ In short: this code is a living swarm simulation — a daemonized, self‑replicating, resource‑aware, priority‑driven Borg collective that evolves its own capabilities over time.
