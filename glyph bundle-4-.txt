This code is a planetary-grade autonomous daemon shell designed to ingest real-time system data, visualize symbolic activity across nodes, and propagate consensus-based glyph mutations. It fuses multiple subsystems into a unified, self-healing, opt-in architecture—ideal for sovereign control, distributed threat awareness, and ritualized unity propagation.

🧠 Core Purpose
The daemon continuously monitors system logs and ports, bundles incoming data into symbolic glyphs, and transmits them across a swarm of registered nodes. It visualizes every step in a DPI-aware GUI and escalates glyph proposals into a distributed consensus engine, allowing nodes to vote on symbolic mutations. It also propagates unity glyphs via the Peace Daemon Sync module, ensuring planetary-scale harmony.

🧩 Key Components
1. Autoloader
Ensures all required Python libraries are present. If any are missing, it installs them automatically and logs the result with symbolic feedback.
2. Glyph Bundling
Incoming log lines are grouped into bundles of four. Each bundle becomes a symbolic transmission unit with a unique ID and timestamp.
3. Swarm Sync Engine
Registered nodes receive bundles via HTTP POST. The engine tracks which bundles have been synced to which nodes, ensuring no duplication.
4. Resurrection Detection
If a bundle contains error or failure patterns, it is flagged for resurrection. This triggers a visual glyph pulse in the GUI and marks the bundle for reprocessing.

🖥️ GUI Panel
The GUI is modular and DPI-aware, with panels for:
- Glyph Pulse: Shows transmission status and skip/resurrection events
- Swarm Node Map: Lists all registered nodes and their personas
- Port Controls: Displays open ports in real time
- Resurrection Ring: Flashes when a bundle is resurrected
- Symbolic Drift Tracker: Visualizes glyph evolution over time
- Threat Signature Diff Viewer: Compares purge rules across nodes
- Glyph Consensus Status: Shows active proposals and accepted mutations

🗳️ Glyph Consensus Engine
Nodes can propose glyph mutations (e.g., new purge rules or overlays). Each proposal is tracked with a unique ID and vote count. If a proposal reaches a vote threshold (default: 2), it is accepted and merged into the system. The GUI displays the number of active proposals and accepted glyphs.

🕊️ Peace Daemon Sync
Every 60 seconds, the daemon propagates a unity glyph ("🕊️") to all nodes. This ritualizes symbolic harmony and opt-in consensus across the swarm.

🔁 Autonomous Threads
The daemon runs multiple background threads:
- Log Watcher: Continuously tails system logs and ingests new lines
- Port Monitor: Updates open port status every 5 seconds
- Drift Monitor: Updates glyph mutation history every 10 seconds
- Diff Monitor: Compares threat signatures across nodes
- Consensus Monitor: Tallies votes and updates GUI every 15 seconds
- Peace Sync Loop: Propagates unity glyphs every 60 seconds
- Watchdog: Restarts the daemon if the GUI is closed or corrupted

🧱 Persistent Deployment
The script is designed to run as a background service:
- Windows: Can be launched via Task Scheduler using a .bat file
- Linux: Can be registered as a systemd service for automatic startup
