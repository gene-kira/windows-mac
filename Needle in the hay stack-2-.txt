🧩 Overall Purpose
This is a defensive, autonomous detection system designed to run on mixed operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS). Its job is to:
• 	Watch processes, network connections, and filesystem changes.
• 	Detect when attackers are trying to blend in by using legitimate tools (like PowerShell, Bash, rundll32).
• 	Adapt its detection rules over time (via the Codex).
• 	Provide trust scores for entities (processes, users, destinations).
• 	Show live feedback in a console (Tkinter UI if available).
• 	Allow interactive commands (, , , , ).

🛠️ Key Components
1. Autoloader
• 	Dynamically imports optional libraries (, , , , etc.).
• 	If a library isn’t available, the system logs a warning but continues running.
• 	This ensures graceful fallback — the system never crashes just because a dependency is missing.

2. Glyphs & Emblems
• 	Uses symbolic glyphs (💀⚔️, 🛡️⚠️, 🜏, 🕊️, 🔱, etc.) as visual markers in logs and console output.
• 	These act like ritualized signals for different states: threat alerts, compliance checks, mutations, defense escalation.

3. Autonomous Cipher Engine (ACE)
• 	Masks or anonymizes sensitive telemetry (like usernames, command lines, file paths).
• 	Ensures that logs can be shared or audited without leaking private data.
• 	Can be toggled on/off interactively.

4. Codex
• 	The adaptive rulebook.
• 	Mutates itself when signals are detected:
• 	Ghost sync → shortens retention, adds phantom nodes.
• 	Obfuscation spike → raises entropy thresholds.
• 	Rare edge spike → increases sensitivity.
• 	Escalate defense → enforces stricter rules (step-up authentication, beacon strict mode).
• 	Keeps version history and can export/import manifests for swarm sync.

5. Trust Model
• 	Assigns dynamic trust scores to entities (processes, binaries, destinations).
• 	Scores increase when anomalies are detected (LOLBin misuse, beacon behavior, credential ops).
• 	Scores decay over time if no anomalies occur.
• 	Used to decide response tiers (observe, friction, quarantine, isolate).

6. Compliance Auditor
• 	Checks whether telemetry retention rules are being followed.
• 	Flags violations like:
• 	Retention too long.
• 	Excessive event scope.
• 	Outputs pass/fail status with findings.

7. DualPersonalityBot
• 	Runs in two modes:
• 	Guardian mode → audits decoys, runs compliance checks, mutates codex safely.
• 	Rogue mode → generates harmless entropy patterns (glyph streams, scrambled data) to probe for anomalies.
• 	Switchable interactively ( command).
• 	Provides continuous background signals every 10 seconds.

8. Collectors
• 	Process monitor → watches for suspicious command lines (LOLBin usage).
• 	Network monitor → logs outbound connections, detects beacon-like behavior.
• 	Filesystem monitor → detects file modifications (startup folders, scripts).
• 	All collectors emit signals into the console/logs.

9. Orchestrator
• 	Wires everything together:
• 	Starts bot + collectors.
• 	Launches governance pulse (exports codex manifest every 30 seconds).
• 	Provides CLI commands:
• 	 → toggle bot mode.
• 	 → force codex mutation.
• 	 → escalate defense rules.
• 	 → toggle ACE.
• 	 → exit system.
• 	Displays live system state in console (Tkinter if available, otherwise logs).

⚡ How It Feels in Action
• 	When you run it, the system starts monitoring immediately.
• 	You’ll see glyph-coded messages streaming in: threats, audits, compliance checks, codex mutations.
• 	You can interactively steer the system with commands — switching modes, escalating defense, anonymizing telemetry.
• 	It’s designed to feel like a living console, not just a static script.

🌐 Big Picture
This script is essentially a prototype of a self-adaptive defense shell:
• 	It doesn’t just log — it mutates its own rules.
• 	It doesn’t just detect — it scores trust dynamically.
• 	It doesn’t just monitor — it visualizes vitality with glyphs and console signals.
• 	It’s built to survive missing dependencies and keep running in degraded mode.
